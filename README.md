# in-vivo_ephys
MATLAB code for clustering and analysis of in-vivo electrophysiology data

Currently works only with the Neuralynx file format (.ntt). The Tetrode class uses part of Fieldtrip, (Copyright (C) 2005), Robert Oostenveld. For more information about Fieldtrip (including license information (GNU) see: http://www.fieldtriptoolbox.org.

To begin, make sure all the files in the repository are on your Matlab path. Navigate to the folder with the Neuralynx files you want to analyse and run the scripts 'han_cluster_cluster.m'.
